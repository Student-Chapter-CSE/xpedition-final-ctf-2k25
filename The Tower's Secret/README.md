## Title

The Tower's Secret

## Description

After the Battle of New York, Tony Stark ensured that the Avengers Tower remained the most secure building on the planet. But S.H.I.E.L.D. recently intercepted a strange file linked to the towerâ€”something Stark left behind, or perhaps something Hydra planted.

Agent Coulson suspects that within this file lies a classified S.H.I.E.L.D. secret, cleverly concealed from prying eyes. Ordinary analysis reveals nothing, but true agents know where to look.

Your mission should you choose to accept it is to examine the file carefully, extract the hidden flag, and keep Hydra from unlocking more secrets.

## Files

- `tower.stl` - A 3D model of the Avengers Tower, which is a file format used for 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD) applications.

## Solution

Just open the STL file in a [online STL viewer](https://www.viewstl.com/) and view the tower from the top. The flag is hidden in the model as an elevated 3D text.
